# C-Sharp-Projects
These are some of the projects I made using C# and .NET Framework.

# Projects:
* [Car Insurance](https://github.com/mdarlow/C-Sharp-Projects/tree/main/CarInsurance).
* [Twenty One](https://github.com/mdarlow/C-Sharp-Projects/tree/main/TwentyOne)

# Car Insurance
This project is an MVC web application that mimics a car insurance website. It takes the 
user's input on policy information and uses business logic to calculate a quote. There 
is also an admin page that allows staff to view all quotes that have been issued.

# Twenty One
Also known as Black Jack, this project mimics the popular card game. It takes user's input 
on the amount of money brought, desired betting amount, and whether to hit or stay. It also 
logs each deal method and its timestamp.
